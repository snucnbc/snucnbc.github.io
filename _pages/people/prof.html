Current Research Interests 
As a theoretical and computational chemistry group, we are currently interested in understanding structure and dynamics of complex chemical, biophysical, and nano-scale systems. We use statistical mechanical theories and computer simulation methods to elucidate structure and dynamics of those systems. In particular, we are currently focusing our efforts on several research topics, including complex fluids, computational nano-optics, bio-physics, and single molecule dynamics. Our research involves formulating statistical models for molecular systems, developing efficient computer simulation methods, and performing molecular modeling studies.
